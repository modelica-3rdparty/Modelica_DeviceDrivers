\abstract{%
There are many cases there simulation applications need to interact with their
environment. Typical examples are Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulators (including
flight, driving, and marine training simulators), Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)
simulators, but also offline process simulators which cannot operate in a
completely self-contained manner and therefore need to be coupled to external
applications. Embedded control applications are another related area which
requires that applications interact with their environment. The
\emph{Modelica\_DeviceDrivers} library, which had its first release as
open-source library in 2012, tries to cater for such use cases. This paper
describes the library for the first time and reports about the numerous
challenges that the project experienced to meet its goal of supporting several
platforms and tools within a standard-conform, platform-generic, feature-rich,
and easy-to-use Modelica library.}

\section{Introduction}
\BTHI{TODO: Bernhard, Tobias}\\

The most common usage of Modelica models is for offline simulation experiments.
However, in many cases simulations need to interact with their environment.
Typical examples are Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) simulators (including flight,
driving, and marine training simulators), Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulators,
but also offline process simulators which cannot operate in a completely
self-contained manner and therefore need to be coupled to external applications.
Furthermore, Modelica can be used for developing (model-based) control
applications which also require interaction with their environment.

There are different approaches for enabling the above mentioned applications in
the context of Modelica. Several development environments offer tool
chains for real-time simulation and/or model-based development of embedded
control applications. Some of these environments can be coupled with Modelica
tools, \textit{e.g.}, by wrapping code which is generated from Modelica tools
into respective tool internal representations which can be connected to hardware
devices in the respective development environment.

The \emph{Modelica\_DeviceDrivers} (MDD) library uses a different approach.
The MDD library provides access to external devices by utilizing Modelica's external
function interface for interfacing to the C API of various device drivers directly from Modelica
models (see Section~\ref{ModelicaDeviceDrivers}).

Historically, the origins of the MDD library can be traced back to the
\emph{ExternalDevices} library \citep{Bellmann2009}\ldots
\BTHI{TODO: Bernhard, Tobias , \cite{Elmqvist2009}}


\section{Modelica\_DeviceDrivers}
\label{ModelicaDeviceDrivers}
\BTHI{TODO: Bernhard, Thomas, Volker}

The MDD library allows to access hardware devices from Modelica models.
This is achieved by using the Modelica external C interface to call the
appropriate C driver functions provided by the underlying operating system (see
Section~\ref{sec:CrossPlatformSupport}).

The library is organized in several layers as indicated in
Figure~\ref{fig:MDDLayeredArchitecture}. Notice that the library
provides two high-level Drag \& Drop block interfaces. The first (\texttt{.Blocks}) is
compatible to Modelica 3.2, using the traditional \modelica{when sample()}
element for periodically calling Modelica functions from the \textsf{Function Layer}. The second
(\texttt{.ClockedBlocks}) uses the synchronous language elements extension
introduced in Modelica 3.3 and is compatible with the
Modelica\_Synchronous library \citep{Otter2012}. Due to this support the MDD
library formally depends on the Modelica\_Synchronous library, but in
practice the Modelica\_Synchronous library (and tool support for the
synchronous language elements extension) is only required if one actually wants
to use the clocked block interface.

\subsection{Cross-Platform Support}
\label{sec:CrossPlatformSupport}

Currently MS Windows and Linux are supported as main platforms, but recent
prototypical work also targets popular embedded systems boards directly (see
Section~\ref{sec:EmbeddedControl}).

When accessing hardware devices, a Modelica model or
application calls Modelica functions from the \textsf{Function Layer} (see
Figure~\ref{fig:MDDLayeredArchitecture}). These Modelica functions provide a
generic interface to the underlying C-code layer which is accessed by
Modelica's external function interface.
The platform differentiation is handled within the \textsf{C-Code} layer which
uses preprocessor directives for conditional inclusion/exclusion of
platform-specific code (\mbox{\clang{#if}}, \clang{#else}, \clang{#endif}, etc.)
similarly to the code fragment below.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#if defined(_MSC_VER) || defined(__CYGWIN__) || defined(__MINGW32__)
#include <windows.h>
/* ... */
#elif defined(__linux__)
#include <unistd.h>
/* ... */
#else
#error "Modelica_DeviceDrivers: No support of XXX for your platform"
#endif
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Applications}

\subsection{Arduino}
\BTHI{TODO: Volker}

The arduino is an open-source electronics platform which makes it very easy to read sensors, process the data and send it to another device via a serial connection \citep{arduino:2016}.
With the help of Modelica Device Drivers serial port implementation, the arduino can be utilized to make sensor data available in a real-time Modelica model.
Using different kinds of potentiometers, it is possible to build customized control devices.
As an exemplary application, pedals for a driving simulator can be equipped with a rotary potentiometer in order to measure the displacement.
This data can be send via a serial connection to a \textit{Blocks.Comunication.SerialPortReceive} in order to drive a virtual vehicle.
Hence, expensive or unavailable input devices can be substituted by self-built constructions.
By using a bluetooth module, a wireless connection between arduino and the simulator is set up easily.
\VWAU{I could add arduino code or an arduino circuit diagram here.}
