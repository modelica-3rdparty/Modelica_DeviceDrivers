/** DLLWrapper library - Library wrapping most of the device driver interface functions into one dynamic link library.

 *
 * Most of the time external C code is directly "injected" into
 * the Modelica library by just including C headers that already
 * contain all the source code (header-only style).
 *
 * However, this approach is not supported by all tools. Some tools need to load an
 * DLL which provides the respective functions.
 *
 * This file just includes most (but not all) of the provided header-only files
 * in order to wrap them into one DLL.
 *
 * In the moment, some files have been omitted, since they might require some extra considerations.
